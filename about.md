Hello! I am Avinash Pandey, a final year undergraduate student at IIT Dhanbad. This is my math blog. I use this place to aggregate my personal notes and thoughts in mathematics. But since the website is public, you're welcome to take a look as well.

In mathematics, my interest lies mainly in number theory, graph theory, and combinatorics. Looking at my interests, one can easily conclude that I am bound to have a liking for algorithms and related topics in computer science as well.
